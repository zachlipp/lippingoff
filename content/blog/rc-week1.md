## Vibes of the week

I've joked with myself this week that _maybe_ starting a new workout program, a new educational program, and dating again is too much to do in one week. I think I'm usually careening between "not doing enough" and "doing too much," and I'm excited to be back on the "doing too much" side of the road.

Let's focus on the Recurse Center side of this story, though. In the best possible way, this week has felt like a month. I have met so many incredible people, been exposed to technologies I had never heard of, and tried to set some standards for the work I'll be doing over the next ~~12~~11 weeks.

I think the core memory of this week, something I'll remember forever, is my first few hours in the Recurse Center's hub. We arrived at 11am to get to see the space. It speaks to how collaborative RC is that the tours are not led by staff but rather by participants from other batches. After the brief tour, we settled into the common space for some bagels and coffee and cookies. And I experienced something I have never seen before: Coders schmoozing. All joking aside, the room was bubbling with people of all sorts for well over an hour, most of whom had never met each other in person, talking about their past experience, why they're doing the program, and what they want to work on over the coming weeks. This was incredible; from the jump, the energy is so high and people were welcoming and ready to share. I have worked at many companies, and not just as a coder, and the social energy in this room had them all beat. This is a vibrant place.

I have to shout out Virtual RC, too. When you're participating in the program, you have access to a top-down, 2D grid that...looks like an office. You can move your avatar around, claim a virtual working space, adopt virtual pets, and - what I think is the coolest feature - join meetings by moving your character to the virtual room hosting them. This is reciprocal, too, so if I join a meeting in Zoom, my avatar shows up in the corresponding room. I have no idea how this works but it is delightful.

This program has already done wonders for my loneliness. I've joked aorund and made small talk, which I haven't been able to do in person for like five years. Several people read my blog and talked to me about it, which has _never_ happened to me. And I'm even keeping up with old friends, too, several of whom are curious about my first week. I have needed to feel this support for a while.

Moreover, I'm excited to be getting back to a mental state where I enjoy coding (I would say "programming," but I want something inclusive of writing blog posts in vim üòà‚è∞). My theory is that this will take three things: Time, support, and exposure. I knew this would take time. I did not know this would also take support. Being around kind people from all different backgrounds who are encouraging each other and sharing with each other is electric...and then you remember you're not just _around_ them, you're one of them. I'm flexing my creative muscles again. I'm sending people encouraging messages. I'm organizing study groups. I'm learning and helping others learn. And on top of this, I'm coding more. When I write _exposure,_ I mean in the _exposure therapy_ sense. I think that in order to enjoy coding again, I had to code again. For me this time, though. Don't give me much credit for this realization; I've had around a dozen very bright people telling me "CODE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN WHILE YOU'RE HERE" for a week. I love it.

## Show and tell of the week

I'm refamiliarizing myself with [`einops`](http://einops.rocks/), a notation for matrix math. I tried an existing tutorial, but I felt like its dependency on Python and Google Collab limited me a bit... so I tried to make an interactive verison.

I wrote some JavaScript to call `tensorflow.js`'s `einsum` implementation and display the results. I think this has a ton of potential to be a teaching tool for `einops`...except these results don't match Python's. [We're figuring it out](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/8227).

I haven't been this excited about coding in a long time. I worked through a meal (oops), and through the start of some meetings (bigger oops!). I think something will come of this and even if it doesn't, it's so great to have some energy for coding again.

## Coolest thing I learned of the week

Most of my learning has been about me. What motivates me? What do I want to do? How do I want to work? How do I handle being overwhelmed? How do I admit I don't know something? How do I ask for help? How do I pick myself up when I'm feeling down?

I'm still learning.

## Side quest of the week

I spent $20 on a lunch salad on Wednesday. I missed my saving throw and took immense psychic damage, so I became fixated on meal prepping for the next week. I thought about this far too much, but I'm going to try bottled cold brew before the gym, prepped breakfast sandwiches, and cooking chicken ahead of time to be put into salads at the office. I cooked and prepped for hours today. We'll see how it goes (and if it works, I'll share some recipes)

## Other RC work of the week
- Configured my "check in" sound effect when I make it into the hub (I chose the [Wind Waker Treasure Chest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A0ida_hYxI) jingle)
- Prepared to take an intensive crash course in mechanistic interpretability in AI
- Learned what "mechanistic interpretability" means
- Prepared to work through [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
- "Wrote" the first draft of this post using [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) which I compiled to use Apple's CoreML libraries for very fast inference. Immediate, accurate transcription for free without anyone else siphoning my voice. I'm grateful it exists (and for the issues that helped me get it to work).

## Things I want to do better next week
- Solidify a routine
- Catastrophize less
- Think smaller in terms of what I want to accomplish
- Write for me, too. In addition to public weekly recaps, I'm writing daily check-ins throughout my batch. This is a great habit, and I want to dedicate some time and space for me, too

## Firsts of the week
- Got to the gym every morning. Sometimes just for cardio, but I'm not enough of a meathead to not count those...yet

- Newsletter created
- Spa room attended
- Overhead presses and Bulgarian split squats performed üçë
- Spotify song embedded
- "Pirate metal" song listened to <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/65AqLyzascFDIQ055nr2dj?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## Flowers of the week
I got to see the best live demo I have ever seen this week, and it was Hannah Robertson's [interactive homage to Kim Beom's _Yellow Scream_](https://hannahilea.com/projects/yellow-scream/). I tried to explain to people that one of the things that excited me about RC is the intersection of coding and art and interactivity and was met mostly with blank stares. In the future, I may just send a link to this project instead.

## Quote of the week
On how starting a run poorly doesn't doom the rest of the run, and doesn't require us to restart the run from the beginning:
> The starting line isn't just the start of the run. There are starting lines everywhere
- Coach Bennett
