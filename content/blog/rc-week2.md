## Vibes of the week

It's not often you get the same advice from your job and your therapist. And yet many people in my life are encouraging me to _give yourself grace._

What does that mean for me now? Well, for _right_ now, it means letting myself write a less-than-great blog post, postponing meal prep until the morning, and punting on one of two take home interviews for the weekend. For more than right now, though, I'm not sure. No part of my life looks like it did a year ago, and no part of it looks like I planned even a few months ago. That's a lot of change in not a lot of time. The more I think about it, the happier I am to be dedicating my time fully to learning and growing. It feels like the right time.

I spent the week at RC prepping for an intensive mechanistic interpretability course. This included extensive linear algebra and PyTorch reviews, and giving myself grace in what I felt I should have remembered from times I've studied these things before.

I still got to the gym every day this week. Incremental progress isn't exciting, but the results of it can be. I suppose this isn't just about lifting, is it?

## Firsts of the week

**East coast earthquake.** I was in the hub and the room shook a bit. I sort of assumed it was construction because I didn't know New York could get quakes. My family was a bit worried, but after reassuring them I was fine I had to have some fun.

## Show and tell of the week

Nothing for code, unfortunately. I did actually clean up and finish putting together the entertainment center that graced the previous photo, though.

## Coolest thing I learned of the week

This week, I saw two _Build `x` from scratch_ style presentations at the hub: [Alexander Petros](https://alexanderpetros.com/) building a dynamic website from an empty directory and [Maud Gautier](https://maudgautier.github.io/) reimplementing the Bitcask database with just base Python. It is so cool to be around this energy and this approach to learning. This week, though, the _coolest_ thing may actually be the _most cursed_ thing: I am very confused that HTML forms only support `GET` and `POST` methods and not, say, `DELETE`.

## Side quest of the week

Come on. Look at that entertainment center again. What a beauty. Yes, the cabinet on the right side isn't set on its hinges right. We can refactor later.

## Other RC work of the week
- Coordinated some folks who are interested in Crafting Interpreters
- Paired with [Benjamin Arnav](https://benjaminarnav.com) on a very cool project they've been working on for a while. I got to see Selinium code in action; it was fun.
- Plenty of 1-on-1s

## Things I want to do better next week

Nothing jumps out at me!

## Flowers of the week

Have you ever wondered what your favorite GitHub repo sounds like? Thanks to Garrett Bodley's _[Turn Your SHA1 into Music If You Want to Do That For Some Reason](https://garrett-bodley.github.io/SHAlala/)_, you don't have to. (Pro-tip: Opt for the McCoy Tyner option to really feel those hashes.)

## Quote of the week

I forget the exact wording, but something like
> If I'm going to commute on Monday, you should, too!
- Wen Xing on flying across the country twice in a week, the hub, and the relative pain of commuting
