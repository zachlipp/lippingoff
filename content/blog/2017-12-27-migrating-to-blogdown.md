Over the past few weeks, I've been toying with the incredible `blogdown` package, 
and I finally have my former GitHub Pages site fully migrated! 

There's not a lot to say here. I only had a few posts on my previous site in part due
to the difficulty of publishing. I would generate markdown files in Sublime and plots 
in RStudio, then spend a fair amount of time styling and linking the graphics properly. 
I am extremely excited to be able to use RMarkdown to display my grpahics as I code them
instead of having to save them separately.

Another incredible benefit of migrating to blogdown has been rendering versions of my
blog locally. Using GitHub Pages, I didn't understand how to preview my posts prior
to pushing them to my master branch. Now, I can render any given post as I write it 
without even leaving RStudio! This makes a huge difference; I now won't have to open Pull Requests
just to fix my typos or fauly hyperlinks. 

Beyond that, I followed the incredible [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)'s
and moved my hosting to Netlify. I enjoy having an actual backend for my site
rather than just pushing to GitHub and praying. The book offers much more guidance through and
through, and I wouldn't have had such ease were both the package and the book not publicly available.

That's about all I've got -- here's to me posting more frequently next year!
