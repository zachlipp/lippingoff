A recording [is available](https://sonatype.cventevents.com/hub/events/9b2a9865-2cb7-48b7-b863-2b9f110ded42/sessions/65ae8838-293f-4142-a649-b4861cb0fd62), but it requires a log in. This is new to this year, or else I wouldn't have spoken at the conference. I owe my career to open source technology, I think it's important to share my learning openly, too.
