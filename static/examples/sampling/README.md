# Sampling p5 code

I decided not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good here and just duplicate a bunch of code and commit untested, untyped, JavaScript with load-bearing comments. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. That said, I am very interested in improving this process in future work. In particular:
- It would be great to actually compose these graphs one piece at a time
- I would love to make the widths of each section more independent
- I would love to do this in typescript instead of JS. I hit over a dozen different errors caused by mismatched types or mismatched arguments and just about every one of them presented in a new and confusing way
- I really want tests!
